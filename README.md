## CMPM 121 - HW 2

### All about Lighting!!

For this HW we focused on lighting a scene and other things.

Lights I added:

1. Spotlight - attached to the helicopter
2. Point light - attached to a wall lamp
3. Emissive light - glowing cat on desk (kinda like a nightlight)
4. Area light - green ambient lighting on the desk
